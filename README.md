# WhatsappAutomation
So I saw this post on Instagram where a guy pranks his friend on messenger by sending automated text messages. I wanted to give it a try on WhatsApp by scrapping content off a PDF file. 

What the code does:

It will take the individual words of the PDF file uploaded and send it individually as a text messages in WhatsApp. It takes way too long send 164 pages word to word(Unless they decide to block you immediately). Personally, my most favorite Screenplay ever is that of the movie 'The Social Network' written by the legendary Aaron Sorkin. So I used it. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of making this fun project.

Requirements:
1) Selenium and PyPDF2. 
(Try in Command Prompt)
pip install selenium
pip install PyPDF2

2) Chrome Driver.
